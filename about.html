		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>Moonbeam Publishing is a company was founded in 2019. We are an independent publishing service that offers all the steps needed to make your book a reality. From editing and revisions to seeling your novel, Moonbeam Publishing is here for you. Our team of agents will be happy to review your manuscripts and to send forth edits to make sure that your dreams of being published become a reality.</p>
			
		<p>After this step, we will send you along to our graphic designers who can design the cover of your novel. From there, we will design the page layout of your novel, print copies for you, and sell your book from our online bookstore and our location in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>
			
		<p>In addition to publishing, we also run our own charity called the Moonbeam Foundation, which helps people in schools and colleges obtain their required reading materials and offers workshops for writing academic essays and creative works.</p>
